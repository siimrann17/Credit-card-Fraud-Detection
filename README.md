# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This was a project where I worked on a Kaggle credit card dataset with 3 lakh rows and 122 features. I used data mining concepts to first clean the data, preprocess it, and then implemented Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find meaningful insights and features highly affecting the target variable. Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression used for classification problems such as this one was also applied to build a model which accurately predicts if a loan should be sanctioned to a new customer or not.
